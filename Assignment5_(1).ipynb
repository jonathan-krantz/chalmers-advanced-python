Here we will focus on the simplest form of Q-learning algorithms, which can be applied when all states are known to the agent, and the state and action spaces are reasonably small.

        "**5a)** A decision tree is a widely used tool when evaluating different actions affected by previously known states/probabilities/actions. The tree splits data into different categories. Consider the choice of dinner. The first categories are, hungry not hungry. If hungry, the next categories are, cooking at home, ordering in or going to a restaurant. If the choice is ordered, the next choice categories are pizza, sushi or Indian. The structure of a decision tree can obviously be used in much more complex situations. When calculating conditional probability, a decision tree is very useful. Dice rolls are a commonly used way to visualise each step in the tree.\n",
        "\n",
        "A decision tree is easily understandable and effective with more simple problems. The model is not as useable with more complex and multi-dimensional problems, where there are more variables to consider and they can change with different actions and where regression is a possibility. \n",
        "\n",
        "Hence the model of random forest. This is a supervised machine-learning algorithm that can handle continuous variables. The basic difference from a decision tree is that it does not rely on a singular decision. It assembles randomized decisions based on several decisions and makes the final decision based on the majority. It does not search for the best prediction. Instead, it makes multiple random predictions. Thus, more diversity is attached, and prediction becomes much smoother.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5b)** One of the big advantages of using a random forest over a decision tree is the ability to evaluate a complete chain of actions, instead of every action isolated. A random forest can therefore be a useful tool to use over a longer decision-making plan, where different actions have different consequences and where variables can vary over time. \n",
        "\n",
        "One drawback of using a random forest over a decision tree is the complexity of the model and the need for programming and computers. A decision tree is easily visualised and can even be shown with just a pen and paper, provided that the problem is relatively small. "
